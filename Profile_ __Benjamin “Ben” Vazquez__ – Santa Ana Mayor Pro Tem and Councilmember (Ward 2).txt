Profile: Benjamin “Ben” Vazquez – Santa Ana
Mayor Pro Tem and Councilmember (Ward 2)
Early Life and Education
Benjamin “Ben” Vazquez was born and raised in Santa Ana, California, to working-class immigrant parents
1 . He grew up on Center Street in Santa Ana and attended local public schools in the Santa Ana Unified
School District (SAUSD) 1 . After high school, Vazquez continued his education at Santa Ana College, then
earned a Bachelor’s degree from California State University, Long Beach, and a Master’s degree from UCLA
2 . His upbringing in Santa Ana instilled in him a deep connection to the community; many of his family
members also work in local education, reflecting a family commitment to giving back to Santa Ana’s youth
3 .

Career as an Educator and Community Worker
Vazquez has been a public school teacher for over 21 years in Santa Ana 4 . He teaches Ethnic Studies
at Valley High School and is known for starting the school’s Ethnic Studies program and organizing
SAUSD’s first annual Ethnic Studies conference 5 . His dedication to education earned him recognition as
an award-winning teacher, and he often emphasizes empowering youth through curriculum and mentorship
4
5 .
Outside the classroom, Vazquez has been deeply involved in grassroots community initiatives:
• He serves as a “cultural worker” with El Centro Cultural de México, a Santa Ana community cultural
center 6 . In this role, he helps promote arts, culture, and community engagement, especially
among Mexican-American and Chicano residents.
• Founder of “I Bike Santa Ana”: Vazquez founded this initiative to promote health, community
building, and bicycle use in Santa Ana 5 . Through community bike rides and events, I Bike Santa
Ana encourages alternative transportation and brings neighbors together.
• Director of “Barrio Writers”: He was the director of Barrio Writers, a writing workshop for teens in
underserved communities 5 . This program provides a platform for youth to develop creative
writing skills and share their voices.
• Co-founder of “Taco Trucks at Every Mosque”: Vazquez co-founded this innovative interfaith
program which brings together Muslim and Latinx communities through shared meals and cultural
exchange 5 . The initiative uses taco truck gatherings at local mosques to build bridges and
solidarity between diverse Santa Ana residents.
Through these roles, Vazquez has demonstrated a longstanding commitment to community
engagement, youth empowerment, and cross-cultural understanding. He is also a homeowner in the
Heninger Park neighborhood of Santa Ana 6 , reinforcing his personal stake in the city’s quality of life
and future.

Entry into Politics and Early Campaigns
Vazquez’s first major entry into local politics came in 2016, when he ran for Mayor of Santa Ana. At that
time, he was known primarily as a teacher and community activist challenging the decades-long incumbent
Mayor Miguel Pulido. Vazquez’s 2016 mayoral campaign focused on investing in youth services and
community programs as a strategy to improve public safety and quality of life, positioning these priorities
against calls for expanded policing 7 . The election highlighted a divide in Santa Ana’s vision: Pulido and
police union-backed allies campaigned on hiring more police officers, whereas Vazquez and like-minded
candidates argued for boosting youth services to address root causes of crime 8 9 .
In the November 2016 mayoral election, Miguel Pulido defeated Vazquez. Pulido won approximately 53%
of the vote to Vazquez’s 33% 10 , a decisive margin (roughly a 20-point difference). Despite the loss,
Vazquez’s campaign elevated his profile as a voice for progressive change in Santa Ana – advocating for
youth, working families, and accountability over the status quo. Observers noted that Vazquez was part of a
post-“Santa Ana Spring” wave of reformers, although in 2016 the police-backed establishment retained
power 11 10 . (Notably, Vazquez’s platform in 2016 foreshadowed many of the issues he would continue
championing, such as youth programs and resisting special-interest influence at City Hall.)

Santa Ana City Council – Ward 2
In 2022, Ben Vazquez ran for the Santa Ana City Council and won the Ward 2 council seat, unseating
incumbent Councilmember Nelida Mendoza. The November 8, 2022 general election for Ward 2 was
extremely close – Vazquez secured roughly 50.9% of the vote, defeating Mendoza by only 80 votes 12
13 . He officially assumed office on December 13, 2022 14 . This victory marked Vazquez’s first elected
office and reflected voter support for his community-first platform in the ward encompassing western and
southern portions of the city. (Ward 2 stretches roughly from 1st Street in the north to Edinger Avenue in the
south, between Fairview and Standard Avenues 15 .)
As Councilmember for Ward 2, Vazquez quickly became known for prioritizing working-class families and
neighborhood needs. In line with his campaign promises, he pledged to ensure “limited citywide resources
benefit working class families and improve quality of life for all Santa Ana residents” rather than serving
special interests 16 . In practice, this has meant: pushing for affordable housing and tenant protections,
supporting park improvements, and scrutinizing city budgets to favor community services. Vazquez often
stresses that the city’s policies and budget should “reflect a vision that prioritizes working class
families” 16 .
On the council, Vazquez is generally aligned with its progressive bloc. He frequently works alongside
colleagues like Councilmember Johnathan Ryan Hernandez and Councilmember Jessie Lopez on initiatives
related to equity, transparency, and police accountability 17 . Conversely, he has been at odds with more
establishment or police-union-aligned members on certain issues. For example, Vazquez has been
described as a vocal critic of the Santa Ana Police Officers Association’s influence in city politics 18 19 .
(In fact, during his 2024 mayoral bid, the police union spent over $71,000 on advertising against Vazquez
20 , highlighting the adversarial relationship stemming from his reform stance.)
Committee Assignments and Roles: As a councilmember, Vazquez also serves on various city and regional
committees (the specifics of his assignments are typically listed on the City of Santa Ana website or council

2

records). His focus areas have included housing and tenant issues, parks and recreation, and police
oversight policy, consistent with his stated priorities.

Mayor Pro Tem of Santa Ana (2025)
On January 21, 2025, Ben Vazquez was unanimously selected by his fellow councilmembers to serve a oneyear term as Mayor Pro Tempore (Mayor Pro Tem) of Santa Ana 21 22 . The Mayor Pro Tem is essentially
the vice-mayor – a councilmember chosen to act as mayor in the mayor’s absence and to assist in
ceremonial duties. The Santa Ana City Council rotates this position annually among its members. Vazquez
succeeded Councilmember Thai Viet Phan in the role 23 .
As Mayor Pro Tem, Vazquez continues to advance his policy agenda while also taking on the additional
responsibilities of the post. He often represents the city at community events, issue forums, and in regional
collaborations when Mayor Valerie Amezcua is unavailable. His elevation to Mayor Pro Tem is noteworthy as
it signifies the confidence of his peers and provides him a larger platform to highlight issues he’s passionate
about. For example, Vazquez uses the Mayor Pro Tem’s platform to publish a Ward 2 monthly newsletter
updating residents on community initiatives, city services, and events – frequently emphasizing themes of
community empowerment and celebrating local improvements (from new park amenities to neighborhood
clean-ups) 16 24 .
Quote: “Giving back to Santa Ana youth and community is not just my passion — it is a shared family goal,”
Vazquez wrote, reflecting on his and his family’s dedication to service 3 . This spirit carries into his
approach as Mayor Pro Tem, where he has stated his intent is to “truly center families and residents” in
all city decisions 4 .

Policy Positions and Voting Record
Councilmember Vazquez is regarded as a progressive policymaker with a track record of championing
working families, renters, immigrants, and youth. Below is an overview of his key policy positions, initiatives
he has led or supported, and notable votes during his tenure:
• Housing Affordability & Rent Control: Vazquez is a strong advocate for tenants’ rights and rent
stabilization. Santa Ana in 2021 enacted Orange County’s first rent control ordinance, and Vazquez
has staunchly defended it from any attempts to weaken or repeal it. He “voted to protect rent
control, ensuring that our families can afford to live in the city amidst rising housing costs” 25 . This
stance has earned him support from renter advocacy groups and ire from landlord interests.
Vazquez consistently frames housing as a human need: he supports expanding affordable housing
projects and policies that prevent displacement of long-time residents. (In 2024, he opposed a
controversial charter amendment that would limit certain renter protections.)
• Public Safety & Police Oversight: Vazquez has worked to balance public safety with
accountability. He supported the creation of Santa Ana’s Civilian Police Oversight Commission
(established in late 2022) aimed at reviewing police misconduct and use-of-force cases 26 . In
mid-2025, when proposals emerged to dilute the commission’s authority before it fully started work,
Vazquez publicly opposed gutting the commission’s powers 18 . “The commission wasn’t there to
review, they were there to investigate,” he argued, emphasizing that robust independent investigations

3

are still possible and necessary 18 . Vazquez voted against ordinances that would curb the
commission’s investigative scope, positioning himself as a defender of police accountability. He
has also been a critic of the police union’s outsized political influence, which he and others claim
undermines reforms. (Notably, Vazquez’s skepticism of simply “tough on crime” approaches dates back to
his 2016 campaign, when he prioritized youth investment over expanding the police force 7 .) At the
same time, Vazquez supports community policing and wants to build trust between law enforcement
and residents – but through oversight and transparency rather than blank-check support.
• Youth Services, Parks, and Recreation: True to his educator roots, Vazquez consistently pushes for
investment in youth and community programs. He has championed budget measures to
increase funding for parks and recreation facilities, saying “our children deserve neighborhoods
that provide a good quality of life for them to grow up healthy.” 27 He backed upgrades to parks, the
creation of new playgrounds and athletic fields, and programs like after-school activities and library
services. In council budget discussions, Vazquez has argued that monies spent on youth programs
and community centers are an investment in crime prevention and future economic growth. He
often highlights success stories of Santa Ana youth and is seen at events like the annual OC Black
History Parade or cultural festivals engaging with young residents 28 . His votes on budgets have
reflected these priorities: for instance, he supported allocating additional funds to park
improvements and opposed any drastic cuts to the youth services budget.
• Economic Development & Labor: Vazquez’s vision of development in Santa Ana puts local workers
first. He has insisted on Community Workforce Agreements (project labor agreements) for major
developments, ensuring they employ local labor at fair wages. “We need good paying union jobs in
Santa Ana,” Vazquez says, explaining why he voted to approve development projects that include
community labor agreements 29 . He is pro-union and has been endorsed by labor-aligned
groups; for example, the California Working Families Party and OC Labor Federation allies have
supported him 30 . Vazquez also advocates for small business support, particularly helping street
vendors and family-owned businesses thrive without excessive red tape, seeing them as part of
Santa Ana’s cultural fabric. However, he has opposed developments that he felt would lead to
gentrification or displacement without community benefits. (He was a skeptic of luxury apartment
projects that lacked affordable units or job guarantees.)
• Homelessness and Public Health: Santa Ana has one of the largest homeless populations in
Orange County, and Vazquez has approached the issue with an emphasis on services and regional
responsibility. In late 2024, when a proposal to toughen the city’s anti-camping laws (banning
camping in public spaces) came up, Vazquez and some colleagues pumped the brakes due to
humanitarian concerns. He raised concerns that the proposal “went too far,” especially in
penalizing people sleeping in their cars 31 . The council initially delayed that ordinance in
November 2024 following these concerns 31 . Vazquez argued that “the city should instead
increase [the] quality of life” services – like shelter, outreach, and mental health resources –
rather than simply criminalize homelessness (as reported of his comments at the meeting) 32 .
By December 2024, a modified ordinance was passed with unanimous council support after
removing the most contentious provisions 33 34 . Vazquez ultimately voted in favor of the refined
anti-camping law (which, for example, excluded those sheltering in vehicles) as part of a broader
strategy that coupled enforcement with increased funding for homeless outreach (he voted yes on a
$3.7 million outreach services contract the same meeting) 35 . Throughout, Vazquez maintained that

4

addressing homelessness requires compassion and regional cooperation – he’s urged the County to
provide more support and often notes Santa Ana has borne a disproportionate burden.
• Immigrant Rights and Government Transparency: Representing a city that is roughly 77% Latino
(many from immigrant families) 36 , Vazquez has been a fierce advocate for immigrant
communities. In 2023-2025, he emerged as a champion of Measure DD – a Santa Ana ballot
measure that, if passed, would allow noncitizen residents (such as legal permanent residents, DACA
recipients, etc.) to vote in local elections. Vazquez strongly supports Measure DD, arguing that
many noncitizen residents are long-time contributors to the community and deserve a voice in city
affairs 37 . (His opponent, Mayor Amezcua, opposed it, citing legal concerns 38 .) This issue became
a defining difference in the 2024 campaign, and Vazquez framed it as part of empowering working
families and immigrants in Santa Ana.
Vazquez has also authored a policy to increase transparency around federal immigration enforcement
in Santa Ana. In May 2025, he requested that the city establish a notification system to inform the City
Council, the police oversight commission, and the public whenever Immigration and Customs Enforcement
(ICE) conducts operations in the city 39 . Explaining the intent, Vazquez said the policy is about
“transparency and trust.” “People should be empowered with information necessary to make informed
decisions for themselves and for their families. It will make Santa Ana safe when we have trust in our government
and our police department,” Vazquez stated at a council meeting 40 . This initiative reflects his broader
philosophy that an informed community can better protect itself and that openness from government
builds confidence, especially in immigrant neighborhoods that might fear secretive ICE raids. Santa Ana has
been a sanctuary city, and Vazquez’s efforts align with that ethos. (The council voted to study potential legal
risks of this ICE transparency policy, with Vazquez advocating for its eventual adoption.)
• Government Accountability and Ethics: Vazquez consistently calls for greater transparency and
accountability at City Hall. He has pushed for measures like independent audits, campaign finance
reform, and inclusive public engagement in city decisions. In his own words, he entered the 2024
mayor’s race “to improve government transparency and accountability” 4 . He supported Santa
Ana’s adoption of a “Sunshine Ordinance” (strengthening public notice and input requirements) and
has demanded ethical conduct from city officials. For instance, he was critical of incidents where
Santa Ana’s former city manager alleged council interference on behalf of the police union 41 .
Vazquez generally positions himself as a reformer aiming to “clean up City Hall”, a phrase he has used
in campaign messaging. In council deliberations, he often asks pointed questions of staff and seeks
disclosure of information, reflecting this accountability mindset.
In summary, Vazquez’s voting record and policy actions align with a left-of-center, community-first
agenda. Whether it’s voting for rent control protections, opposing unchecked police power, or
investing in youth and public spaces, he tends to prioritize the needs of vulnerable residents and the
long-term public interest. This approach has earned him a loyal following among progressives in Santa
Ana, even as it sometimes puts him at odds with more conservative or business-oriented factions.

Election Campaigns and Platforms
2016 Mayoral Campaign
Vazquez’s 2016 bid for mayor (as discussed earlier) centered on “investing in our youth instead of more
police” – effectively, a platform of community investment vs. traditional law-and-order. He was a political
newcomer then, and although unsuccessful, that campaign established his reputation as an independent
progressive voice willing to challenge entrenched powers. A noteworthy aspect of 2016 was Vazquez’s
support from the grassroots: community volunteers, students, and activists rallied for his candidacy as part
of a broader movement for change in Santa Ana politics. (Pulido’s victory in 2016 was bolstered by heavy
police union spending against Vazquez 42 10 , a dynamic that would recur in later races.)

2022 City Council Campaign (Ward 2)
Running for the open Ward 2 council seat in 2022 (incumbent Mendoza had been appointed in 2020 and
was seeking a full term), Vazquez outlined a campaign platform focused on “putting families first.” Key
planks of his 2022 platform included: strengthening tenant protections (as Santa Ana’s rent control law was
newly in effect, he pledged to defend it), expanding affordable housing, combating homelessness with
humane solutions, increasing park space in Ward 2, and improving traffic safety and infrastructure in
neighborhoods. He also emphasized education partnerships – leveraging his teacher background to
bridge city programs with local schools.
Vazquez campaigned as an outsider to City Hall but an insider to the community. He was not backed by big
developers or the police union, which helped him frame his candidacy as free of special-interest strings.
Instead, he earned endorsements from community organizations, progressive Democrats, and figures like
former Councilman (now O.C. Supervisor) Vicente Sarmiento. Ultimately, his door-to-door grassroots
outreach and credibility as a long-time teacher contributed to his narrow 2022 victory. (Vazquez won with
~51% in a two-person race 43 , reflecting both strong support in his base and a nearly evenly split electorate.)

2024 Mayoral Campaign
In 2024, Councilmember Vazquez ran for Mayor of Santa Ana, challenging incumbent Mayor Valerie
Amezcua in the November general election. His campaign message in 2024 closely mirrored his work on
the council and amplified it citywide. Vazquez ran on a progressive platform, which can be summarized as
follows 44 45 :
• “Putting Santa Ana Families First”: Vazquez’s slogan and core theme was prioritizing working-class
families in all policies. He promised to “continue to fight for working families” and ensure City Hall
“truly centers families and residents” 4 46 . This included affordable housing, rent control,
childcare support, and community health initiatives.
• Education and Youth Partnerships: Vazquez called for building stronger partnerships with the
SAUSD School Board and local educational institutions 47 . He argued that the City and schools
working together could better address youth needs – for example, coordinating after-school
programs, joint use of school facilities for community events, and investing in youth jobs/training.
(Mayor Amezcua herself was a former school board member, but Vazquez claimed more could be done to
bridge city government and schools.)

6

• Public Safety Reform and Accountability: He advocated for greater police accountability and
fully empowering the new oversight commission 47 . He also pledged to hire a permanent police
chief committed to reform, implement community policing, and expand programs like the Be Well
OC mobile response for mental health crises (to reduce reliance on police in non-criminal situations).
Notably, he criticized what he saw as undue influence of the police union on the incumbent mayor;
his campaign highlighted that Amezcua was under scrutiny for allegedly doing favors for the police
union president (an allegation investigated but not officially sustained) 48 . By contrast, Vazquez
positioned himself as “not beholden to the police union” and willing to hold police accountable.
• Transparency and Ethics: Vazquez emphasized government transparency, accountability, and
fiscal responsibility. He promised regular town halls, participatory budgeting elements (giving
residents a say in budget priorities), and stricter ethics rules to prevent conflicts of interest. He often
repeated that Santa Ana residents “deserve a Mayor who…follows through on responsible spending
and government transparency” 46 .
• Investing in Neighborhoods: His platform included improving basic city services – repaving streets,
fixing sidewalks, enhancing lighting, and cleaning up public spaces in long-neglected
neighborhoods. He also proposed expanding the city’s Youth Resource Center and creating more
community centers in dense areas of the city.
• Homelessness and Housing: Vazquez proposed expanding shelter capacity in partnership with the
County, but also took a firm stance that every part of the county must do its fair share so Santa Ana
is not the “dumping ground” for the region’s homeless. He supported the anti-camping ordinance
only alongside increased outreach and services. Additionally, he supported exploring a “housing
first” model with permanent supportive housing development.
• Noncitizen Voting Rights (Measure DD): A distinctive part of Vazquez’s 2024 platform was his
support for Measure DD, the local ballot measure to allow non-citizen residents to vote in city
elections 37 . “Santa Ana residents deserve a voice, regardless of citizenship status, in the local decisions
that affect their families,” he argued (as paraphrased from campaign statements). He frequently
spoke at community forums about how many Santa Ana residents are immigrants who pay taxes
and have kids in local schools, and thus should have a say in city leadership. This stance energized
many immigrant and refugee community members, though it was controversial for others. The
measure ultimately did not pass in 2024, but Vazquez’s advocacy on this issue solidified his standing
as a champion for immigrant inclusion.
Campaign Endorsements (2024): Vazquez assembled a notable list of endorsements for his mayoral run,
emphasizing his support from progressive groups and local leaders. For instance, he was endorsed by
Orange County Supervisor Vicente Sarmiento (Santa Ana’s former mayor) and by all members of the
Santa Ana Unified School Board 49 . He also earned backing from organizations such as the California
Working Families Party, OC Action, the Democratic Renters’ Council, and the Chicano/Latino
Immigrant Democratic Club of OC 30 . Two of his council colleagues, Johnathan Ryan Hernandez and
Jessie Lopez, endorsed him as well 50 – a reflection of the council’s ideological split (with Amezcua being
supported by other members and the police union). These endorsements underscored Vazquez’s
positioning as the progressive choice in the race. On the other hand, Amezcua received endorsements
from more establishment figures (e.g. a former police chief, some neighboring city officials) and did not
secure the Democratic Party endorsement due to the split (the party remained neutral as both candidates
were Democrats).
Media and Debates: During the campaign, Vazquez appeared in local candidate forums and interviews. In
media coverage, he was often described as an “ethnic studies teacher turned reformer councilman.” The LAist
voter guide, for example, noted that “he was voted [onto council] on a platform to improve the life of working

7

class families” and highlighted his focus on police oversight, youth investment, and transparency 44 45 .
Vazquez frequently cited his record from his first council term to bolster his promises. In one forum, he
stated, “As a Councilmember, I fought tirelessly to ensure we have a City Hall that centers families… As Mayor, I’ll
continue that fight” 4 46 . He also proudly pointed out that he refused donations from corporate landlords
and had a campaign largely funded by small donors and volunteers, aligning with his message of
accountability.
Election Outcome 2024: The mayoral election took place on November 5, 2024. Valerie Amezcua was reelected, defeating Ben Vazquez. Early tallies on election night showed Amezcua with a significant lead –
roughly 24 percentage points ahead, equating to about 11,100 more votes than Vazquez in initial counts
51 . The final certified results confirmed Amezcua’s victory by a wide margin (she secured a clear majority
of the vote). Vazquez conceded the race and continued in his capacity as a councilmember. Despite the loss,
his campaign succeeded in bringing issues like noncitizen voting and police reform into the local dialogue,
and he solidified his role as a key voice on the council’s progressive wing.
It’s worth noting that Santa Ana’s mayoral seat is a two-year term (with a term limit of four consecutive
terms) 52 53 . Amezcua’s win means she will serve until 2026, and Vazquez will have the option to run
again in 2026 should he choose. Meanwhile, his council term for Ward 2 continues until December 2026, so
he remains an influential elected official in Santa Ana’s governance.

Public Statements and Notable Initiatives
Throughout his public service, Ben Vazquez has made numerous statements that shed light on his values
and priorities. He is known for plain-spoken, passionate rhetoric centered on community
empowerment. Below are a few notable public statements and initiatives he has been involved in,
illustrating his approach:
• Centering Families in Government: “I have fought tirelessly to ensure we have a city hall that truly
centers families and residents,” Vazquez wrote in 2024 4 , emphasizing that every policy should be
evaluated by how it benefits the people of Santa Ana rather than outside interests. This quote
encapsulates his north star in public office – making local government responsive to everyday
Santaneros.
• Quote on Transparency (ICE Notification Policy): When advocating for transparency about ICE
operations, Vazquez articulated the link between information and public trust: “People should be
empowered with information necessary to make informed decisions for themselves and for their families.
It will make Santa Ana safe when we have trust in our government and our police department.” 40 This
statement, delivered at a May 2025 council meeting, highlights how Vazquez ties transparency to
public safety and community well-being, particularly for immigrant families who might fear
government secrecy.
• Resolution on International Human Rights (Israel-Palestine Ceasefire): In December 2023,
Vazquez co-authored a controversial resolution calling for a ceasefire in the Israel-Gaza conflict,
amid the humanitarian crisis in Gaza 54 55 . He and Councilmember Hernandez introduced the
resolution voicing support for civilians and a halt to violence. The issue sparked heated public debate
in council chambers, with large turnouts from both pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli community
members. Ultimately, the council deadlocked and no formal stance was adopted, as there was not

8

enough support to pass any version of the resolution 55 56 . Mayor Amezcua opposed Vazquez’s
ceasefire resolution, and other members offered alternate wording, but none garnered a majority
57 . The meeting became chaotic, reflecting how global issues reverberated locally. Vazquez’s
involvement showed his willingness to take a stand on international human rights issues from the
local dais – a move that supporters praised as moral leadership, but critics (including some local
bloggers) derided as overstepping city purview or even labeled “anti-police” or “anti-Israel.” Despite
failing to pass the resolution, Vazquez stood by the intent, stating that Santa Ana, as a diverse city,
had residents directly affected by the conflict and thus “couldn’t stay silent on humanitarian concerns.”
This incident underscores Vazquez’s activist streak and readiness to use his platform for advocacy
beyond traditional municipal issues.
• Joint Statements and Community Advocacy: Vazquez has often joined forces with fellow
progressive officials and community groups to issue statements or lead rallies on various causes. For
example, he has spoken at renter rights rallies, at school board meetings in support of ethnic
studies expansion, and in 2023 he was part of a joint statement opposing the attempted recall of
two council colleagues (Hernandez and Lopez) which they attributed to special interests like the
police union and apartment association 48 . In that instance, Vazquez stood with the targeted
councilmembers and argued the recall was an undemocratic power grab. Such actions display his
loyalty to allies and his consistent opposition to what he views as the undue influence of moneyed
interests in Santa Ana politics.
• Media Presence: While not a national figure, Ben Vazquez does engage with local media and uses
social media to communicate with constituents. He maintains an active Instagram account
(@benjaminvazquezforsantaana) where he posts updates on community events, photos from
neighborhood clean-ups, and short videos explaining his votes or stances. With a few thousand
followers, his social media serves as a grassroots outreach tool (e.g., highlighting a recent
recognition of the youth group Chicanos Unidos for community impact 58 ). Vazquez has appeared in
local news articles and on podcasts focused on Orange County politics. The nonprofit newsroom
Voice of OC frequently quotes him in articles about Santa Ana issues (such as those on police reform
or housing), and he has been interviewed by community radio and Spanish-language media given
Santa Ana’s large Latino population. In all these appearances, Vazquez’s tone is consistent:
passionate about social justice and unabashedly proud of Santa Ana’s communities. He often mixes
English and a bit of Spanish when addressing bilingual audiences, reflecting his cultural background.
• Community Engagement as an Official: As a councilman, Vazquez makes a point to attend
numerous community events – from neighborhood association meetings to cultural festivals. He has
been seen rolling up his sleeves at park clean-ups, leading bike rides for health awareness, and
reading to children at library story hours. In recognition of his community presence, local
organizations frequently invite him as a guest or honoree. For instance, in 2023 he was honored by
Los Amigos of Orange County (a longstanding community advocacy group) for his work in
education and civic engagement. Vazquez often brings a teacher’s touch to these appearances:
listening to residents’ concerns and explaining city policies in straightforward terms. Many
community members know him on a first-name basis from years of activism before he held office.
In summary, Vazquez’s public statements and media engagements reinforce the personality of a
grassroots activist turned public servant. He remains accessible to the community and unafraid to speak
out on contentious issues, always circling back to how decisions affect the people of Santa Ana. As LAist

9

described in a 2024 election profile: “He was voted in on a platform to improve the life of working class
families… championing police accountability, investments in youth and increased government transparency.” 59
These are the threads that tie all his public communications together.

Community and Political Affiliations
Ben Vazquez is officially a nonpartisan officeholder (all Santa Ana city positions are nonpartisan), but his
affiliations and endorsements place him firmly in the progressive Democratic camp. He is a registered
Democrat and aligned with the party’s liberal wing. Some of his notable affiliations and support networks
include:
• Democratic Party & Clubs: Vazquez has the support of progressive Democratic clubs. For example,
the Chicano Latino Immigrant Democratic Club of Orange County endorsed him in 2024 30 . He’s
also known to work with groups like OC Progressive Coalition and Orange County Young
Democrats on voter outreach. In Santa Ana’s Democratic circles, he is seen as an ally of figures like
Vicente Sarmiento and Johnathan Hernandez who prioritize social justice issues.
• Labor Unions: As a career public school teacher, Vazquez is a member of the Santa Ana Educators
Association (the local teachers’ union) and has been endorsed by teacher unions and the Orange
County Labor Federation in his campaigns. He often appears at union rallies – for instance,
supporting hotel workers during contract fights or teamsters during labor actions. His emphasis on
union jobs and labor agreements in development stems from these pro-labor values.
• Community Organizations: Vazquez has long-standing ties with local nonprofits and advocacy
groups. He is associated with Resilience OC and Chispa (youth-led immigrant rights groups in OC) –
he has attended their events and supported their policy asks such as language access and
immigrant legal defense funds. Coalition of Orange County Community Organizations (COCO), a
network of grassroots groups, is another circle where Vazquez is respected; he worked with them on
a successful push for Santa Ana’s sanctuary city resolution years ago. Additionally, Vazquez’s
involvement with cultural and arts groups (El Centro Cultural de México, Barrio Writers, etc.) means
he’s well-connected in arts advocacy circles.
• Allies on the Council: Politically, Vazquez is often allied with Councilmembers Johnathan Ryan
Hernandez (Ward 5) and Jessie Lopez (Ward 3), who share similar progressive platforms. The trio,
sometimes along with Thai Viet Phan (who is a swing vote on some issues), have formed a voting
bloc on certain key votes (e.g., defending rent control, establishing police oversight). They were all
opposed by a police union-led recall attempt in 2022-2023 (aimed at Hernandez and Lopez) and
stood together against it 48 . On the other hand, Mayor Amezcua, Councilman Phil Bacerra, and
Councilman David Penaloza have often taken positions opposite Vazquez’s on issues like law
enforcement and development, reflecting a split in Santa Ana’s leadership. This dynamic has
sometimes been described in local media as the “police-backed faction” vs. the “progressive/working
families faction,” with Vazquez firmly in the latter.
• Regional/State Connections: Vazquez’s advocacy has also connected him with statewide
progressive movements. He was endorsed by the California Working Families Party, indicating he’s
part of a network of left-leaning candidates statewide 30 . He has appeared with State
Assemblymember Avelino Valencia and State Senator Josh Newman at events (though those officials

10

remained neutral in the mayor’s race). Moreover, Vazquez’s platform overlapping with issues like rent
control and immigrant voting rights has led to partnerships with statewide organizations such as
Tenants Together and Inclusive Democracy PAC. There is speculation that if Vazquez continues in
politics, he might seek higher office or regional boards, given his connections and support base.
Overall, Vazquez’s affiliations paint the picture of a community-rooted progressive Democrat whose
support comes from teachers, union workers, immigrants, and activists rather than corporate donors or
law enforcement groups. This base both empowers him to push bold policies and also makes him a target
for opposition from established interests (as evidenced by heavy police union spending to defeat him in
2024 20 ).

Conclusion
Ben Vazquez is a figure who bridges roles as an educator, community activist, and elected official. From his
early days empowering youth in the classroom and on the streets of Santa Ana, to his current position as
Mayor Pro Tem, Vazquez has consistently championed the underrepresented. His profile is that of a
progressive reformer: he centers working families in policy, stands up to powerful interests like the police
union, and isn’t afraid to introduce bold initiatives (be it rent control or immigrant voting rights) to advance
equity in his city.
Vazquez’s impact on Santa Ana can be seen in various ways – a strengthened rent control ordinance
protected under his watch, a nascent police oversight body reflecting his accountability ethos, new bike
lanes and park improvements in Ward 2 neighborhoods, and heightened civic engagement among
residents who feel heard by leaders like him. His public statements often invoke transparency, trust, and
community, reflecting a belief that democracy works best when people are informed and involved. “Santa

12

Ana residents deserve a Mayor who respects all residents, prioritizes investment in youth and neighborhoods, and
follows through on responsible spending and government transparency,” Vazquez wrote during his campaign
46 , effectively summing up the standard he strives to meet.
Looking ahead, Councilmember Vazquez remains a pivotal voice on the City Council. With two years left in
his term, he will likely continue to advance his policy agenda and could seek the mayor’s seat again or other
higher office in the future. For now, he remains deeply engaged in Santa Ana’s civic life – attending
community events on the weekends, teaching his ethnic studies classes on weekdays, and spending long
evenings in council sessions debating how to make Santa Ana a better place for its 310,000 residents 63 .
Through all these roles, Ben Vazquez exemplifies the motto of servant leadership; as he often reminds
constituents, “Giving back to Santa Ana isn’t just my duty as a councilmember – it’s my passion as a neighbor.”
